# Pic2lcd

A small utility that converts images to data that can be displayed on monochrome OLED / LCD panels like those driven by SSD1306, SH1106 and ST7920. Currently, this program can only take png images, and is compatible with only monochrome displays.

## Features

- Performs dithering on the image. The default algorithm is Jarvis, Judice, and Ninke (jjn), with a number of other options.
- Outputs either hex values or decimal values. Python users that read the output with the *csv* library might find the decimal format easier to work with.
- Customisable value delimiter. The default is a comma plus a space, which produces `0x95, 0x40, ...`. You can change this with the `--delimiter` option.
- Compatible with screens with both vertical bytes in memory (e.g. SSD1306) and horizontal bytes (e.g. ST7920).
- Bit order (LSB / MSB) can be changed.

## Compiling

Pic2lcd has only been compiled on Linux, but it should be compatible with other build environments given the proper headers and compiler are set up.

1. Install the *tclap* and *png++* library headers. This should be available from your distro's repositories.
2. Clone this repo: `git clone https://gitee.com/lsquared618/pic2lcd.git`
3. `cd pic2lcd`
4. `make`

In case you want to remake, use `make remake`.

## Options

### Dithering options

- `-a, --algorithm`: Select a dithering algorithm to use. Valid values are `jjn`, `floyd_steinberg`, `stucki`, `atkinson`, `burkes`, `sierra`, `sierra_2_row`, and `sierra_lite`. You can see the algorithms in the file *dither_algorithms.h*.
- `-t, --threshold`: Set the value above which a pixel should be considered white when dithering. The value of the pixelâ€™s brightness minus the errors distributed to it will be compared with the threshold, and the pixel will be white if that value is above the threshold.

### Data output options

- `-s, --delimiter`: Set the string that separates each value when output. Default is a comma and a space, i.e. `", "`.
- `-l, --lsb`: Output values LSB first. Useful for screens where the LSB of a byte is oriented towards the origin.
- `-d, --decimal`: Output decimal values instead of hex.
- `-i, --inverse`: Swap 1s and 0s so that a bright pixel is a 0 and a dark pixel is a 1. Useful for screens where pixels are dark when turned on.
- `-b, --horizontal-bytes`: Output every 8 pixels in a row as a byte, instead of every 8 pixels in a column. FYI, SSD1306 uses vertical bytes and ST7920 uses horizontal bytes.

### Other options

- `-r, --save-dithered`: Save the dithered image as *dithered.png*.
- `--version` and `-h, --help`: They do what they say.
